# DirectionalAC
Air conditioning with face tracking so you can stay cool wherever you are.

This is a project made for CSH's Imagine RIT 2019 project.
Directional AC utilizes OpenCV, a webcam, a Raspberry Pi, and a few servos to enable a car's AC unit to always be blowing on you wherever you are in the cabin.
