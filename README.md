Facial tracking-enabled climate control so you can stay cool wherever you are.

This is a project made for CSH's Imagine RIT 2019 project.
Directional AC utilizes OpenCV, a USB camera, an Arduino, a few servos, and three 3D printed brackets to enable an AC unit to automatically adjust its airstream to you wherever you are in the cabin.

## Building and running

```
$ cmake .

$ make

$ ./dirac
```

## Future Plans:
  - Improve the CAD
  - Build another one
    - Make two work as a pair. Keep scaling up the system from there.
  - Implement CUDA for better performance
